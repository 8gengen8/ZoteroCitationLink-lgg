# ZoteroCitationLink-lgg
     An MS Word macro that links Zotero author-date or numeric style citations to their bibliography entry. This program has been **improved and expanded** based on https://github.com/altairwei/ZoteroLinkCitation. **Specifically, we have developed corresponding functional tabs on the Word toolbar to enable quick and permanent access**.
